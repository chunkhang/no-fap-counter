# No Fap Challenge Counter
I am an advocate of the [No Fap Challenge](https://www.nofap.com). As such, I saw the need for a day counter that is easy to access and use on the computer. To learn more about the challenge, I recommend the dedicated [NoFap subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/).

## Before Starting
* Make sure you have [Python 3](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/install3/osx/) installed on Mac
* If you already have Python 3, you should be able to launch the interpreter in Terminal: <br /> 
  ```
  $ python3
  ```

## Running It
* You can run [noFapCounter.py](/src/noFapCounter.py) using Terminal: <br />
```
$ cd path/to/program
$ python3 noFapCounter.py
```
* Alternatively, you can make it [executable](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/36564320/how-to-make-python-script-executable-on-osx): <br />
  * Include this line in .bashrc: <br />
    ```
    export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/program/
    ```
  * Now you can run this from Terminal: <br />
    ```
    $ noFapCounter.py
    ```
