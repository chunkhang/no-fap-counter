# No Fap Challenge Counter
I am an advocate of the [No Fap Challenge](https://www.nofap.com). As such, I saw the need for a day counter that is easy to access and use on the computer. To learn more about the challenge, I recommend the dedicated [NoFap subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/).

## Requirements
### Git
Git is required to download the program and fetch future updates. Click [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) to learn how to install Git.
### Python 3
Python 3 is required to run the program. Click [here](http://www.diveintopython3.net/installing-python.html) to learn how to install Python 3.

## Installation
Type this into the console or terminal:
```sh
$ cd Desktop
$ git clone https://github.com/chunkhang/no-fap-counter
```

## Usage
Feel free to move the **no-fap-counter** folder anywhere, but do leave the contents intact. 
### Windows
Windows users can either use the console to run the program, or simply double-click the **noFapCounter.py** file. Create a shortcut to make the process easier. 
```sh
$ no-fap-counter\src\noFapCounter.py
```
### Mac
Mac users need to employ the terminal to run the program. Create an [alias](http://www.hostingadvice.com/how-to/set-command-aliases-linuxubuntudebian/) to make life simpler.
```sh
$ python3 no-fap-counter/src/noFapCounter.py
```
