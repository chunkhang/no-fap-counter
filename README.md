# No Fap Challenge Counter
I am an advocate of the [No Fap Challenge](https://www.nofap.com). As such, I saw the need for a day counter that is easy to access and use on the computer. To learn more about the challenge, I recommend the dedicated [NoFap subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/).

## Requirements
### Git
Git is required to download the program and fetch future updates. Click [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) to learn how to install Git.
### Python 3
Python 3 is required to run the program. Python 2 does not work. Click [here](http://www.diveintopython3.net/installing-python.html) to learn how to install Python 3.

## Installation
Type this into the console or terminal:
```sh
$ cd Desktop
$ git clone git@github.com:chunkhang/no-fap-counter.git
```

## Usage
Feel free to move the **no-fap-counter** folder anywhere, but do leave the contents intact. Windows users can create a [batch file](http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/write-simple-batch-bat-file/) to make the process easier. Mac and other Unix users can create an [alias](http://www.hostingadvice.com/how-to/set-command-aliases-linuxubuntudebian/).
```sh
$ cd path/to/folder
$ python src/noFapCounter.py
```

## Updates
To ensure that you are using the latest version, check the changelog to see whether the date matches your program's last-updated date. To update your program, fetch the changes from GitHub:
```sh
$ cd path/to/folder
$ git pull git@github.com:chunkhang/no-fap-counter.git
```
