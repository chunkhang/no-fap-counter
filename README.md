# No Fap Challenge Counter
A console-based day counter for the No Fap Challenge.

## Note
This program has only been tested on Mac.

## Before Starting
* Make sure you have [Python 3](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/install3/osx/) installed on Mac
* If you already have Python 3, you should be able to launch the interpreter in Terminal: <br /> 
  ```
  $ python3
  ```

## Running It
* You can run [noFapCounter.py](/src/noFapCounter.py) using Terminal: <br />
  ```
  $ cd path/to/program <br />
  $ python3 noFapCounter.py
  ```
* Alternatively, you can make it [executable](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/36564320/how-to-make-python-script-executable-on-osx): <br />
  * Include this line in .bashrc: <br />
    ```
    export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/program/
    ```
  * Now you can run this from Terminal: <br />
    ```
    $ noFapCounter.py
    ```
